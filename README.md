**The purpose of this study is to analyse AI-generated code, with a focus on software engineering use-cases. examine the fundamental differences between AI-generated and human-written code, to explore the capabilities of AI tools to complete coding assignments, and to determine whether AI tool use can be consistently detected.** 

The core focus areas of this reasearch are described below.

### [Analysis of AI- and human-written code](ST2%20SS21%20Data%20Analysis)

AI chatbots (ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-3.5, Bing Chat and Bard) were used to generate code solutions to Java programming tasks (milestone assignments) taken from the 2021 presentation of the [Software Engineering 2](https://www.archi-lab.io/regularModules/ss22/st2_ss22.html) Bachelor's course at TH KÃ¶ln. Student solutions to the same assignments were stored anonymously.

The differences between the AI and human written code solutions to "milestone 0" are analysed, and a simple classification model was trained to distinguish between AI and human written code. For the analysis, two approaches are compared: representing the code using manually defined features, and by OpenAI's text embedding vectors.

### [AI- or student-written code predictions](AI%20or%20Student%20Predictions)

In order to determine how effectively AI generated code can be detected "by eye", a mixed set of AI- and human-written code solutions to the ST2 SS21 milestone 0 assignment was anonymised and given to two faculty members, who made predictions as to whether each solution was written by either a student or AI chatbot.

### [Analysis of AI- and human-written Python code](Python%20Data%20Analysis)

ChatGPT was used to generate Python code solutions to the [HumanEval](https://github.com/openai/human-eval) problem set. The differences between the AI and human-written canonical code solutions are analysed, and a model is trained to distinguish between the two classes. The feature and embedding representation approaches are compared.

### [ChatGPT capabilities experiment](ST2%20SS23%20AI%20Solutions)

In order to evaluate the capabilities of ChatGPT at completing assignments for software engineering university courses, purely AI written code (from ChatGPT-4) was generated for the solution to the Software Engineering 2 course 2023 milestones, comprising of the creation of a complex e-commerce system.

### [Experiences and guidelines](Experiences%20and%20Guidelines)

My experiences with generating code using each of the chatbots, and evaluation of their strengths and weaknesses, and a set of guidelines for using AI tools to write code.
