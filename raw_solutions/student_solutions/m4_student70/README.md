## Milestone M4 - Implementing a REST-API

Last time you defined a REST-API for your project. Now it is time to implement it.

### Exercise 1 - Implementing a REST-controller

Implement a REST-controller for your cleaning device aggregate.
You have to fulfill the following eight requirements:

|Requirement # | URI | VERB |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Get all cleaning devices                                                                      | /cleaningDevices | GET |
| 2. Create a new cleaning device                                                                  | /cleaningDevices | POST |
| 3. Get a specific cleaning device by ID                                                          | /cleaningDevices/{cleaningDevice-id} | GET |
| 4. Delete a specific cleaning device                                                             | /cleaningDevices/{cleaningDevice-id} | DELETE |
| 5. Change the name of a specific cleaning device                                                 | /cleaningDevices/{cleaningDevice-id} | PATCH |
| 6. Give a specific cleaning device a task                                         | /cleaningDevices/{cleaningDevice-id}/tasks | POST |
| 7. List all the tasks a specific cleaning device has received so far                        | /cleaningDevices/{cleaningDevice-id}/tasks | GET |
| 8. Delete the task history of a specific cleaning device                                    | /cleaningDevices/{cleaningDevice-id}/tasks | DELETE | 

Use the provided class Cleaning deviceController to implement your REST-API. 

**Important:** 
1. Your cleaning device class needs to have an attribute called `name`.
1. The `CleaningDeviceService` from M3 has been split into three service classes, each dedicated to one aggregate. 
    Please migrate your M3 service class implementation to these three locations, accordingly.
    * `CleaningDeviceService`
    * `SpaceService`
    * `TransportCategoryService`
1. Please do not change the given package structure in your repo. (You can add own packages, but don't move or
    rename those that came with the repo.)
