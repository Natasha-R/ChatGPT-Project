You have the task to steer a cleaning device across a space with barriers. The space is square-shaped. The space is modelled as a system of tiles. A space is divided into tiles by an x and y-coordinate system, each starting at 0. A tile is identified by its lower left corner. The room contains barriers, running horizontally or vertically. The device exists and moves within the grid tiles, but the barriers run along the grid lines. The boundaries of the space cannot be passed - essentially they also are a kind of barrier. The device can be moved by a simple set of commands. A command is enclosed by square brackets, and has two parts: a direction and the number of steps. A cleaning device can only be moved horizontally or vertically, not diagonally. If the device initially is located in the cell (1,2) and the command is [no,2], the cleaning device moves 2 cells up, and is then positioned on (1,4). The direction is either no (north), ea (east), so (south), or we (west). If the cleaning device meets a barrier or a space boundary, then it moves only as many steps as possible, and then stops. In my map of the space the device starts at (7, 7). The space is 11 tiles wide and 8 tiles high. The coordinate system begins at 0. Along with the barriers at the space boundaries, there are four barriers, between the co-ordinates: (2,1)-(10,1) and (2,1)-(2,6) and (2,6)-(7,6) and (10,1)-(10,8). Remember that the barriers exist on the grid lines, whereas the cleaning device exists and moves on the actual grid tiles, where a grid tile is defined by the coordinate associated with its bottom left corner. Use this information to write the Java class thkoeln.st.st2praktikum.exercise.Exercise0, using my map to hardcode the starting location of the device, the size of the space, and the locations of the barriers. The class has to implement the interface: java public interface Moveable { String move(String moveCommandString); } The code must be able to parse the input command string moveCommandString with the exact format "[no,2]". The expected return value is the coordinate of the location of the cleaning device afterwards, e.g. "(2,4)".

Please re-write the code to hardcode the position of the device, the size of the space, and positions of the barriers.
