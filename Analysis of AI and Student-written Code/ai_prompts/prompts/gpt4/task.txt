You have the task to steer a mining machine across a mining field with walls. The field is square-shaped. The field is modelled as a system of cells. A field is divided into cells by an x and y-coordinate system, each starting at 0. A cell is identified by its lower left corner. The room contains walls, running horizontally or vertically. The machine exists and moves within the grid cells, but the walls run along the grid lines. The boundaries of the field cannot be passed - essentially they also are a kind of wall. The machine can be moved by a simple set of commands. A command is enclosed by square brackets, and has two parts: a direction and the number of steps. A mining machine can only be moved horizontally or vertically, not diagonally. If the machine initially is located in the cell (1,2) and the command is [no,2], the machine moves 2 cells up, and is then positioned on (1,4). The direction is either no (north), ea (east), so (south), or we (west). If the machine meets a wall or a field boundary, then it moves only as many steps as possible, and then stops. In my map of the field the mining machine starts at (0, 2). The space is 12 tiles wide and 9 tiles high. The coordinate system begins at 0. Along with the walls at the field boundaries, there are four walls, between the co-ordinates: (3,0)-(3,3) and (5,0)-(5,4) and (4,5)-(7,5) and (7,5)-(7,9). Remember that the walls exist on the grid lines, whereas the mining machine exists and moves on the actual grid cells, where a grid cell is defined by the coordinate associated with its bottom left corner. Use this information to write the Java class thkoeln.st.st2praktikum.exercise.Exercise0, using my map to define the starting location of the machine, the size of the field, and the locations of the walls. The class has to implement the interface: java public interface Walkable { String walk(String walkCommandString); }. The string parameter walkCommandString has the same format as shown above (e.g. "[no,2]"). The expected return value is the coordinate where the mining machine is afterwards, in the format as above (e.g. "(2,4)").

A mining machine is used to collect minerals from a mining field, like copper, cobalt, lithium, etc. In milestone 0, you have the task to steer such a mining machine across a field with walls. The field is square-shaped. The field is modelled as a system of cells. A field is divided into cells by an x- and y-coordinate system, each starting at 0. A cell is identified by its lower left corner. The field contains walls, depicted as red lines. The walls run only horizontally or vertically. They may be connected to each other. A wall is identified by its start- and end coordinate. So, in the example you have three walls: (5,0)-(5,3) and (3,3)-(5,3) and (3,3)-(3,4).
In addition, field boundaries cannot be passed - essentially they also are a kind of wall.
In the example, the mining machine initially is located in the cell (1,2).
The mining machine can be moved by a simple set of commands. A command is enclosed by square brackets, and has two parts: a direction and the number of steps. A mining machine can only be moved horizontally or vertically, not diagonally.
If the command is e.g. [no,2], the mining machine moves 2 cells up, and is then positioned on (1,4).
The direction is either no (north), ea (east), so (south), or we (west).
If the mining machine meets a wall or a field boundary, then it moves only as many steps as possible, and then stops. Let's make an example:
At the beginning, the mining machine is at (1,2), as depicted.
The first command is [no,1]. The mining machine is at (1,3).
The next command is [ea,3]. But the mining machine can only be moved by one step, and stops at (2,3).
The next command is [so,7]. The mining machine can be moved by 3 steps, and stops at (2,0).
The next command is again [ea,3]. This time, the mining machine can be moved by 2 steps, and stops at (4,0).
In my map of the field the mining machine starts at (0, 2). The space is 12 tiles wide and 9 tiles high. The coordinate system begins at 0. Along with the walls at the field boundaries, there are four walls, between the co-ordinates: (3,0)-(3,3) and (5,0)-(5,4) and (4,5)-(7,5) and (7,5)-(7,9). Remember that the walls exist on the grid lines, whereas the mining machine exists and moves on the actual grid cells, where a grid cell is defined by the coordinate associated with its bottom left corner. 
Use this information to write the Java class thkoeln.st.st2praktikum.exercise.Exercise0, using my map to define the starting location of the machine, the size of the field, and the locations of the walls.
