## Milestone M3 - Persistence and REST API

In this milestone, you need to make the mining machine world persistent. In addition, you need to define a
REST-API. (The implementation follow in the next milestone M4). For the REST API, you also have to define
aggregates.

### Exercise 0 - Adding a transport technology

Every connection now belongs to a specific transport technology, e.g. a helicopter or a transport belt.
A transport technology can have one or several connections. You now need to specify a transport technology 
if you want to create a new connection.


### Exercise 1 - Making the mining machine world persistent

Use the Java Persistence API to make your Project persistent. Use your knowledge from ST1 to create the required 
classes:
* Entities
* Value Objects (Embeddables) 
* Repositories



### Exercise 2 - Identifying aggregates

You need to identify the **aggregates** in your domain model in order to specify the REST API. Please use the table in 
**`main/resources/E2.md`** to specify each aggregate root, and other entities or value objects contained
in the aggregate. 

These are the entities / VOs that you **must** list in the table. If you have additional entities or VOs, you can
add them as well. 

1. MiningMachine 
1. Field
1. Task
1. Vector2D
1. Wall
1. TransportTechnology
1. Connection


### Exercise 3 - Designing a REST API

Design a REST API for mining machine steering with the following functionality:

1. Get all mining machines
1. Create a new mining machine
1. Get a specific mining machine by ID
1. Delete a specific mining machine
1. Change the name of a specific mining machine
1. Give a specific mining machine a task
1. List all the tasks a specific mining machine has received so far
1. Delete the task history of a specific mining machine
1. Get all fields
1. Create a new field
1. Get a specific field by ID
1. Delete a specific field
1. Make a specific field larger, by specifying a new (larger) width and/or height
1. Get all walls contained in a specific field
1. Delete all walls contained in a specific field
1. Add a new wall to a field
1. Delete a wall on a field
1. Get all transport technologies
1. Create a new transport technology
1. Create a new connection for a transport technology
1. Get all connections of a specific transport technology
1. Delete a specific connection in a transport technology

Please use the table in **`main/resources/E3.md`** to specify your REST-API.
 
**Important (1)**: 

As stated in the corresponding videos, creation of a value object can be done in two ways. 
1. By using `PUT /things/{thing-id}/myValueObjects/the-string-represention-of-that-value-object`, 
    and an empty request body (i.e. you use the fact that a value object is fully characterized by its
    attributes, and that their `toString()` output serves as an ID), or
2. By using `POST /things/{thing-id}/myValueObjects`, and the value object is located in the request
    body. 

Both ways are valid, but we assume the option (2) in this exercise. For GET and DELETE, option (1) is fine.

**Important (2)**: 

When you specify the REST URIs above, you **must** write IDs in the following way: 
`/things/{thing-id}`
`/otherThings/{otherThing-id}`
This applies to **both entities and value objects**.  


**Important (3)**: 

We use and expect the "lower CamelCase" way of writing a REST endpoints, both for URIs and for IDs. 
I.e. a class called `ArchiLabDocument` will have a REST endpoint like `GET /archiLabDocuments/{archiLabDocument-id}`.
